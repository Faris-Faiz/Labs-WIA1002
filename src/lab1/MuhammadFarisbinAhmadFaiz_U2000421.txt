My name is Muhammad Faris bin Ahmad Faiz with matrix number, U2000421. I am 
majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling scared about taking this subject. This is because this subject is known to be hard!! 

I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will diligently attend classes, alongside doing all the tutorials and labs!!! Wish me luck!!!
